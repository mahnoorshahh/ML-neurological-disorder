This project develops an AI system for detecting dementia using MRI images. By applying machine learning algorithms, it aims to enhance early detection of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Key features include:

Dataset: 6400 MRI images categorized into four classes.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Gabor Filters for extracting textural features.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers.
Results: Achieved 93.75% accuracy with Gabor Filter and Random Forest.
The project highlights the effectiveness of Gabor Filters for feature extraction in dementia detection, with future work aimed at finer-grained classification for early diagnosis.
